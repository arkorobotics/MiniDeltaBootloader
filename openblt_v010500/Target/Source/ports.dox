\defgroup   Ports Bootloader Ports
\brief      Target dependent code.
\details    The bootloader targets contain the microcontroller and compiler dependent
            parts of the bootloader. They are grouped per microcontroller family. This is
            the part that needs to be newly developed when porting the bootloader to a
            new microcontroller family.
