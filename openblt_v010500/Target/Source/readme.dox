\details
\section into Introduction
This documentation covers the OpenBLT (Open source BootLoader Tool) firmware. With 
OpenBLT you can make software updates through an on-chip communication interface 
(UART, CAN, TCP/IP, USB etc.), without the need of specialized debugger hardware.

\section arch Software Architecture
The software program's architecture is divided into 4 major categories, namely the
application code (App), target independent code (Core), target dependent code 
(Target), and compiler specific code (Comp).

To configure and fine-tune the bootloader for integration in your product, all you have 
to do is take the demo bootloader project for the microcontroller and compiler you are
using, and (optionally) modify just the application code (App) to fit your needs. This
typically involves changing the configuration header file (blt_conf.h) and the 
implementation of the hook functions (hooks.c).
